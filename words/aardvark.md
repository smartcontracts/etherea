# Aardvark

An aardvark is a nocturnal mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa, known scientifically as Orycteropus afer. It has a pig-like snout and long ears, and it uses its powerful claws and long, sticky tongue to dig for and eat ants and termites. Despite its appearance, the aardvark is not closely related to pigs or anteaters but belongs to its own order, Tubulidentata. Its name comes from Afrikaans, meaning "earth pig."
